Starting an Open Source Project at {forgeName}
----------------------------------------------

{forgeName} open source projects start with a proposal that is made
available to the community for review. At the end of the 'community
review' period, we engage in a 'creation review', and then
provision the project resources.

----
include::../../dotfiles/project-creation.dot[]
----

Use the {createurl}[web form] to create a new project proposal. 
Instructions are provided on the form. All new proposals are created
in 'draft' mode, and are accessible only by the original author and
anybody designated as a project lead or committer in the proposal.
Only those individuals designated as a project lead may edit the
proposal.

NOTE: Keep track of the URL of the proposal. We do not provide 
public links to the document until after the proposal is opened for
community review.

A proposal must minimally include a description of the project, a 
declaration of scope, and a list of prospective members (project 
leads and committers) before we make it accessible to the public
for 'community review'.

When you feel that the proposal is ready, send a note to 
the Eclipse Management Organization (EMO) at {emoEmail} requesting that 
the proposal be made available to the public for review. The EMO
will review the proposal and may provide feedback before initiating
the 'community review' period.

At the beginning of the 'community review' period, the EMO will
announce the proposal on several channels (the {activityUrl}[Project
Activity News] page, Twitter, the 
{proposalsForum}[Proposals Forum], blog post, and an email note
to the Eclipse Foundation members and committers). The EMO will
also open an record in the Eclipse Foundation's issue tracker--an 
instance of Bugzilla--to track the progress of the proposal; 
the proposal's author and project leads will be copied on that record.

A proposal will be open for community review for a minimum of two
weeks.

The Eclipse Foundation holds the 'trademark' for all {forgeName} projects.
Trademark assignment is undertaken prior to the creation of any new
project. If you already have a trademark on your project name, that
trademark must be assigned to the Eclipse Foundation. Be advised that
trademark assignment can be a time-consuming process (it can take hours,
days, or weeks depending on the circumstances surrounding the name).
If you currently hold the trademark, you will be asked to complete a
{trademarkTransferUrl}[Trademark Transfer Agreement].

The proposal must list two mentors from the Architecture Council.
Members of the Architecture Council have considerable experience with 
Eclipse Foundation practices, and the {edpUrl}[Eclipse Development Process].
If you are already in contact with mentors who agree to help you with 
your project, please do list them in the proposal. Otherwise, the 
EMO will engage directly with the Architecture Council to identify
mentors as necessary. Mentors are available to the project through the
incubation phase; they are released from their duties when the project 
<<release-graduation,graduates>>.

When the project name trademark has been secured, mentors have been
identified, and the proposal contents are finalized, the EMO will schedule
a 'creation review'. Reviews--which run for a minimum of one week--are 
scheduled twice a month, generally concluding on the first and third 
Wednesday of each month. The creation review may overlap with the 
'community review' period.

NOTE: Creation reviews tend to always be successful. They should be
considered low stress as the hard work has already been done in
advance of the start of the review.

Following the creation review, the EMO will initiate the provisioning process. 
To gain committer status, some <<paperwork,committer paperwork>> must be completed
as part of the provisioning process. The exact nature of that 
paperwork depends on several factors, including the employment status 
of the individual and the Eclipse Foundation membership status of their employer.

NOTE: If you can be ready with the paperwork in time for the completion of the 
creation review, then we can move quickly through the provisioning process. 
When we initiate provisioning, committers will be sent an email with 
instructions; please don't send any paperwork in until after you receive 
those instructions.

[[starting-after-provisioning]]
After Provisioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Webmaster will send a note announcing the completion of the provisioning
process. Before you commit any code into your project repository, you must
submit your project's <<ip-initial-contribution,'initial contribution'>> and
list of third-party libraries for review by the IP team.

----

Do not commit any code to your project's source code repository until after
you receive approval for the IP Team. Once you've received that approval,
you can do builds and produce milestones for your first release. You must
wait until after the IP Team has approved your initial contribution and use
of third-party libraries before you do any official <<release,releases>>.

[[starting-project-phases]]
Project Phases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All new projects start in the 'incubation phase' (a project in the
incubation phase is said to be 'incubating'). The classification of 
a project in the incubation phase is not a statement about the quality 
of the project's code; rather, incubation phase is more about the 
project team's progress in practicing the open and public processes 
necessary to establish the three communities (developers, adopters, 
and users) around the project.

image::{imgsdir}/Egg-incubation.png["The Incubation Logo"]

In order to alert potential consumers of the incubating nature,
projects in the incubation phase must include 'incubation branding':

* Display the incubation logo on their project web page (if they have one);
* Displays the incubation logo on their project's primary download page;
* Include the word "incubation" in the filename of all downloadable 
files (when technically feasible) for builds and milestones; 
* When technically feasible, include the word "incubation" in features
(e.g. about dialogs, feature lists, and installers).

There are no incubation branding requirements for general
user interface elements.

For projects that produce OSGi artifacts, include the word 
"incubation" in the 'Bundle-Name', feature names, and p2 repositories.

NOTE: The word "incubation" should not be included in technical
namespaces (especially when it may result in confusion when the project
leaves incubation). e.g. an OSGi bundle's 'Bundle-SymbolicName', or a
Java package name.

Incubating projects that correctly conform to the incubation branding
rules outlined above may take advantage of the <<ip-parallel-ip, Parallel
IP Process>>. They are encouraged to produce milestone builds, make 
releases, and grow their community.

When the project code is ready (e.g. stable APIs) and the project team
has learned to operate as an open source project according to the
Eclipse Development Process, the project may opt to 'graduate' into
the 'mature phase'.

Most of the lifetime of {aForgeName} project is spent in the mature phase. 
A mature project is one that is a good open source citizen with open, 
transparent, and meritocractic behavior. The project is regularly 
and predictably releasing IP clean extensible frameworks and 
exemplary tools. The project is actively nurturing the three 
communities: developers, adopters, and users.

Frequently Asked Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[qanda]
How do I find Architecture Council mentors? ::
	You don't have to find them yourself. Focus on the content of the
	proposal. We can solicit mentors from the Architecture Council after
	the proposal has been opened for community review.

Can I change the proposal after it is posted? ::
	Yes. The proposal can be changed any time before the start of the
	start of the creation review.

When do I submit my code for review by the IP team? ::
	Submit your code (initial contribution) for review after the project
	has been provisioned. The Eclipse Webmaster will let you know via
	email when provisioning is complete.

Does the new project have to use Git? ::
	Yes. Git is the only source code management system that is currently
	permitted for new projects. 

Can I host my project code on GitHub? ::
	New projects can make use of <<resources-github,GitHub>>. Official project repositories
	must be moved under the {gitHubUrl}[{forgeName} Organization] at GitHub. 
	Official repositories are subject to the same intellectual
	property due diligence rules and processes that all Eclipse project
	repositories must follow. 

How long should I let my project incubate? ::
	It depends. Community expectations are one factor. Team experience
	with open source is another. If your team is new to open source,
	it may make sense to stay in incubation a little longer than a
	seasoned team with a mature code base might. As a general rule,
	though, projects should plan to leave incubation within a year.
	
Does the mature project code that I'm bring to {forgeName} need to incubate? ::
	Yes. All new projects start in the incubation phase. Remember
	that incubation is as much about the project team learning about
	how to operate as an open source project as it is about the 
	project code. Project teams that "get it" can opt to exit
	incubation quickly (e.g. with their first release) if that 
	makes sense for the team and the community.
	
What do all these terms (e.g. EMO) mean? ::
	Please see the <<glossary,glossary>>.
