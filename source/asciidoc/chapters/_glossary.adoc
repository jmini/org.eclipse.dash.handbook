[glossary]
Architecture Council ::
	The Eclipse Architecture Council (AC) serves the community by identifying and 
	tackling any issues that hinder Eclipse's continued technological success and 
	innovation, widespread adoption, and future growth. This involves technical 
	architecture as well as open source processes and social aspects. Comprising 
	the finest technical leaders from all community stake holders, it is the council's 
	goal to keep the projects successful and healthy, the processes simple and smooth, 
	and the communities vibrant and cohesive.

Architecture Council Mentor ::
	The Eclipse Architecture Council (AC) is a body of battle-hardened Eclipse committers. 
	All new projects are required to have a minimum of two mentors taken from the ranks 
	of the AC. Your project mentors will help you find answers to any questions you may 
	have about the Eclipse Development Process and life-in-general within the Eclipse 
	community. If your mentor doesn't have an answer to your question, they can draw 
	on the wisdom of the full AC and the EMO.

Board of Directors ::	
	The business and technical affairs of the Eclipse
	Foundation are managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors
	(or more simply, "The Board"). 

Committer ::
	A committer is a software developer who has the necessary rights to write code 
	into the project's source code repository. Committers are responsible for ensuring 
	that all code that gets written into the project's source code repository is of 
	sufficient quality. Further, they must ensure that all code written to an 
	{forgeName} source code repository is clean from an intellectual property point 
	of view. This is discussed with more detail below.

Community ::
	Community is a nebulous sort of term. Community is the group of individuals and 
	organizations that gather around your project. In the case of some projects, the community 
	is enormous. Other projects have smaller communities. Developing a 
	community is a very important part of being {aForgeName} project as it is from the 
	community that you get feedback, contributions, fresh ideas, and ultimately new 
	committers to help you implement your shared vision.
	The '{forgeName} Community' is formed from the union of the communities that grow 
	around individual projects.

Contribution Questionnaire ::
	Prior to committing a significant contribution of content from a non-committer 
	to {aforgeName} project, the committer must fill out a <<ip-cq,contribution questionnaire>> (CQ) and 
	submit it to the IP Team for approval. In addition to the 
	EMO, the relevant PMC must also provide a technical review and approval of the contribution.
	In general, ongoing development by project committers does not require EMO or PMC approval. 
	When in doubt, consult the {ipDueDiligenceUrl}[Eclipse IP Due Diligence Process].

Contributor ::
	A contributor is anybody who makes contributions to the project. Contributions
	generally take the form of code patches, but may take other forms like comments
	on issues, additions to the documentation, answers to questions in forums, and
	more.

Dash Process ::
	The Dash Process, or simply _Dash_, is a collection of scripts and processes that
	harvest project data for dissemination in charts, <<ip-iplog,IP Logs>>, and more. 

Dev-list ::
	Every project has a 'development list' or 'dev-list'. All project 
	committers must subscribe to the list. The dev-list should be the primary means
	of communication between project committers and is the means throuh which the
	Eclipse Foundation's automated systems communicate with the project.

Ecosystem ::
	A commercial ecosystem is a system in which companies, organizations, and individuals 
	all work together for mutual benefit. There already exists a vast ecosystem of companies 
	that base significant parts of their business on {forgeName} technology. This takes the 
	form of including {forgeName} code in products, providing support, and other services.
	You become part of an eco-system by filling the needs of commercial interests, being 
	open and transparent, and being responsive to feedback.
	Ultimately, being part of a commercial ecosystem is a great way to ensure the 
	longevity of your project: companies that build their business around your project 
	are very motivated to contribute to your project.

Eclipse ::
	Now this is a tough one. For most people in the broader community, "Eclipse" refers to a
	Java IDE based on the JDT project and assembled by the Eclipse Packaging Project. However, 
	the term "Eclipse" is also used to refer to the Eclipse Foundation, the eclipse.org website, 
	the community, the eco-system, and--of course--The Eclipse Project (which is just one of 
	the top-level projects hosted by the Eclipse Foundation). Confusing? Yes.

EMO ::
	The Eclipse Management Organization (EMO) consists of the Eclipse Foundation staff, and the Architecture and Planning
	Councils. The EMO is responsible for providing services to the projects, facilitating 
	project reviews, resolving issues, and more. The EMO is the maintainer of the Eclipse 
	Development Process. The best method of contact with the EMO is by email ({emoEmail}). 
	If you have a question that cannot be answered by project lead, mentor, or PMC, ask the EMO.

EMO Executive Director ::
	The EMO Executive Director (EMO/ED) is the head-honcho at the Eclipse Foundation. He is 
	ultimately responsible for all the goings-on at the Eclipse Foundation.

EMO IP Team ::
	The EMO Intellectual Property Team (commonly referred to
	as the 'IP Team') is responsible for implementing the intellectual
	property policy of the Eclipse Foundation.
	
EMO Records ::
	The EMO Records Team (commonly referred to as 'EMO Records') is 
	responsible for managing committer paperwork and other records 
	on behalf of the Eclipse Foundation. Contact the EMO Records team via email 
	({emoRecordsEmail}).

Incubation Phase ::
	The purpose of the incubation phase is to establish a fully-functioning open-source project. 
	In this context, incubation is about developing the process, the community, and the technology. 
	Incubation is a phase rather than a place: new projects may be incubated under any existing project.	

IP Due Diligence Process ::
	The {ipDueDiligenceUrl}[Intellectual Property Due Diligence Process] defines the process by which
	intellectual property is added to a project. All {forgeName} committers must be familiar
	with this process.

IP Log ::
	An <<ip-iplog,IP Log>> is a record of the intellectual property (IP) contributions to a project. 
	This includes such as a list of all committers, past and present, that have worked on the 
	code and (especially) those who have made contributions to the current code base.
	
Member Company ::
	The Eclipse Foundation and Eclipse community is supported by our member organizations. 
	Through this support, the Eclipse Foundation provides the open source community 
	with IT, Intellectual Property, Mentors and Marketing services.
	
Parallel IP ::
	The <<ip-parallel-ip,Parallel IP Process>> allows {aForgeName} projects to make use of
	project code contributions and third-party libraries before they
	are fully approved by the IP Team.

Planning Council ::
	The Planning Council is responsible for cross-project planning, architectural issues, 
	user interface conflicts, and all other coordination and integration issues. The Planning 
	Council discharges its responsibility via collaborative evaluation, prioritization, and compromise. 

Project::
	Projects are where the real work happens. Each project has code, committers, 
	and resources including a web site, source code repositories, space on the build 
	and download server, etc. Projects may act as a parent for one or more child 
	projects. Each child project has its own identity, committers, and resource. 
	Projects may, but do not necessarily, have a dedicated web site. Projects are sometimes referred 
	to as 'subprojects' or as 'components'.  The Eclipse Development Process, however, 
	treats the terms project, subproject, and component as equivalent.

Project Lead ::
	The project lead is more of a position of responsibility than one of power. The 
	project lead is immediately responsible for the overall well-being of the project. 
	They own and manage the project's development process, coordinate development, 
	facilitate discussion among project committers, ensure that the Eclipse IP 
	policy is being observed by the project and more. If you have questions about 
	your project, the {edpUrl}[Eclipse Development Process], or anything else, ask 
	your project lead.

PMC ::
	Each top-level project is governed by a Project Management Committee (PMC). The 
	PMC has one or more leads along with several members. The PMC has numerous 
	responsibilities, including the ultimate approval of committer elections, and 
	approval of intellectual property contributions. Effectively, the PMC provides 
	oversight for each of the projects that are part of the top-level project. 
	If you have a question that your project lead cannot 
	answer, ask the PMC.

PMI ::
	The Project Management Interface (PMI) is the system that tracks the state
	and progress of {forgeName} projects. Project committers can modify the the
	information represented in the PMI, including the project description, and
	information about project releases. Automated systems use this information
	to, for example, generate dashboard and chart information for the project,
	intellectual property logs, etc.
	
Top-Level Project ::
	A top-level project (sometimes referred to as a 'TLP') is effectively a 
	container for projects that do the real work. 
	A top-level project does not generally contain code; rather, a top-level project contains 
	other projects. Each top-level project defines a charter that, among other 
	things defines a scope for the types of projects that it contains. Top-level 
	projects are managed by a Project Management Committee.

Webmaster ::
	The Webmaster team is responsible for maintaining the IT infrastructure
	of the Eclipse Foundation and the {forgeName} forge. You can contact the
	Webmaster team directly via email ({webmasterEmail}).
	
Working Group ::
	Eclipse https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups[Working Groups] provide 
	a vendor-neutral governance structure that allow organizations to freely 
	collaborate on new technology development.
