Releases
--------

Releases are formal for {forgeName} projects. They start with planning,
and end with a community review. You can capture as many future releases as you'd like. It's 
common practice to specify releases three or six months into the future.

Releases are broadly categorized as:

* 'Major' releases include API changes (potential for downstream breakage);
* 'Minor' releases add new functionality, but are API compatible with previous versions; and
* 'Service' releases include bug fixes only and include no significant new functionality.

For all major and minor releases, you must engage in a 'release review'.
Release reviews are not required for bug-fix/service releases.

[[releases-plan]]
A project plan is 'required' for each major and minor project release.
The plan should lay out in broad terms what the goals are for the
release. As plans are a valuable means
for the community to get involved with your project, the plan should be
created at the beginning of the release cycle. By establishing the plan
early, you give prospective contributors help in determining how they
can most usefully contribute, and adopters can prepare their own
development schedule and themes. Plans can change during the release
cycle.

Use the <<pmi, Project Management Interface>> to create a new release
record. At the start of the release cycle, your plan should minimally
include a release number, date, and short description. Think of the
description as an "elevator pitch": how would you describe the release
in a fifteen second elevator ride? All aspects of a plan can change 
during the release cycle (including the date). If you do change the plan, 
make sure that the change is communicated via your project's 'dev' list 
and other project channels.

The 'Plan' tab in the release record contains numerous fields for capturing
plan information. The amount of information that you should capture
for a release plan varies by top-level project, so consult with your
Project Management Committee (PMC) for advice.

Producing regular builds is an important part of the release cycle.
Builds are an important means of engaging with the community: adopters can
help you test your code and test their own so that they can be ready for
the eventual release. Plan to produce at least one 'milestone' build (more
are better, depending on the length of your release cycle), and capture
the planned date for that milestone in the release record. It is also
common practice to generate nightly and weekly integration builds. Ensure that
your project's downloads page provides the information required for the
community to obtain your builds.

All of your project's <<ip,intellectual property>> contributions
must be approved by the IP Team before you can release
(this includes third-party libraries and contributions of code to be
maintained by the project).

[[release-review]]
Release Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A 'release review' is a formal announcement of your release to the
community and a request for feedback. In practical terms, experience
has shown that those individuals and organizations who are interested 
in your project follow development throughout the release cycle and so 
are have likely already provided feedback during the development
cycle (i.e. they are unlikely to provide feedback during the review
period). With this in mind, the review generally serves as a means for 
a project to engage in a retrospective of the progress made during the
release, discover areas of potential improvement, demonstrate that the 
project is operating in an open and transparent manner, and ensure that 
the development process and intellectual due diligence processes have 
been followed.

Release reviews run for a week and always conclude on a Wednesday. 

NOTE: We schedule reviews to conclude on the 'first and 
third Wednesdays of the month'. Your release date does not have to 
coincide with the review date (you can set the release date as
necessary). The review must, however, conclude successfully before you
can make the release official.

A 'release review' requires review documentation and an intellectual
property (IP) log check. The review process must be initiated at least
two weeks in advance of the anticipated 'review' date.

Prepare the review documentation well in advance of the start of the
review period. The release record which contains your project plan
also includes a 'Review' tab with appropriate fields for a review.
As with the plan fields, all of the review fields are optional and
the level of detail you need to provide varies by top-level project.
You can assemble review information during the release cycle (there's 
no need to wait until the end)

The review materials must be approved by the PMC; send an email to 
the PMC's mailing list asking for approval. The PMC will respond with
feedback or a simple "+1" indicating approval.

NOTE: Click the handy 'Send Email to the PMC' link under 'Committer Tools'
on the release record page to connect with the PMC.

Submit the IP Log for review by the IP Team. The IP Team must approve
the IP Log before we can schedule the review, so submitting this early
is important. The <<ip-iplog-generator,IP Log generator>> automatically 
collects information based on the information that the project team has 
provided to the IP Team through <<ip-cq,contribution questionnaires>> 
in IPZilla, commits in the project's source code repository, and
other information in our databases. Carefully review the IP Log before
submitting to the IP Team for their review.

NOTE: Click the handy 'Generate IP Log' link under 'Committer Tools'
on the release record page to open the IP Log generator.

The information used to generate an IP Log should always be up-to-date
(don't wait until the end of the release cycle to make it right).

At any point in this process, you can request that the review be
initiated by clicking the 'Schedule a review for this release' link
that appears at the top of the release record page. This will invite you
to select a review date. You must then follow up with the EMO to approve
the review. 

NOTE: The EMO will likely notice that you've created the release record, 
connected with your PMC, and submitted an IP Log for review by the IP 
team and will take steps to initiate the actual review. However, since 
there is a great deal of variability in this process, send an email to
{emoEmail} stating your intent to release.

The EMO will conclude the review on the scheduled end date and advise the
project team of the outcome.

[[release-graduation]]
Graduation Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of a 'graduation review' is to confirm that the project has
a working and demonstrable code base of sufficiently high quality
active and sufficiently diverse communities; has adopters, developers, and users
operating fully in the open following the {edpUrl}[Eclipse Development Process]; and
is a credit to {forgeName} and is functioning well within the larger {forgeName} community

Graduation reviews are generally combined with a <<release-review, 'release review'>>
(typically, but not necessarily the '1.0' release).
Upon successful completion of a graduation review, a project will leave the
incubation phase and be designated as a 'mature' project.

For a graduation review, release review documentation must be augmented to 
include demonstration of:

* solid working code with stable APIs; 
* an established and growing community around the project;
* diverse multi-organization committer/contributor/developer activity; and
* operation in the open using open source rules of engagement.

The graduation review documentation should demonstrate that members have 
learned the ropes and logistics of being {aForgeName} project. That is,
the project "gets the {forgeName} way".

Frequently Asked Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[qanda]
Can a release review fail? ::
	Technically, yes. A release review can fail. In our history, however, this
	occurrs very rarely. We set up release reviews to succeed.

Do we really need to do this? ::
	Yes.

How often should we do releases? ::
	This depends very much on the nature of your project and the expectations 
	of your community and stake holders. If you're not sure, connect with your
	mentors and top-level project for guidance.

How much effort should we put into this? ::
	The amount of effort varies based on the nature of the team, and 
	expectations of the community and stake holders. Generally, though, a project
	team shouldn't spend more than a couple of hours working directly on the
	formal aspects of the release review.
	If the amount of effort seems too onerous, you may be trying too hard.
	Connect with your project mentors, top-level project's PMC, or the 
	mailto:{emoEmail}[EMO] for guidance.


How do I submit the IP Log for review? ::
	Click the 'Submit' button on the <<ip-iplog-generator,IP Log generator>>. 
	You need to be logged in as project committer to have access to this button.

Can I accept contributions after I submit the IP Log for review? ::
	The short answer is 'yes'. Please do accept contributions.
	If you require a new contribution questionnaire (for either a third
	party library or code contribution) after submitting the IP Log for
	review, please ask the mailto:{ipTeamEmail}[IP Team] if
	they want you to resubmit the IP Log.

How do I obtain PMC approval? ::
	Send the the PMC a note via the top-level project's 'PMC' mailing list
	with a link to the release record. Note that the release record page
	has a handy link labeled 'Send Email the PMC' under 'Committer Tools'.

I need to do a release now. Can you fast-track the review? ::
	While we do try to be as accommodating as possible, the answer is no. 
	We have a well-defined process with predictable dates. Please plan
	accordingly.

Can a project in the incubation phase do releases? ::
	Yes. In fact, we encourage projects to do at least one release while
	in incubation phase.

What restrictions are placed on version names for incubating projects? ::
	Projects in the incubation phase generally use version numbers that
	are less than 1.0. This is, however, a convention not a rule. If it makes sense
	for you community and adopters to use higher numbers, then do so.
	If you're not sure, ask your top-level project PMC for advice.

How do I name/number milestone builds? ::
	Milestone builds should contain the name/number of the release suffixed
	with "Mn" (e.g. the second milestone for EGit 3.2 may have a file
	named "egit-3.2M2"). Projects in the incubation phase may produce 
	milestone builds for their graduation release, e.g "myProject-1.0M2".

How can I get help? ::
	Contact your mentors (for projects in the incubation phase), top-level
	project PMC, or the mailto:{emoEmail}[EMO].
