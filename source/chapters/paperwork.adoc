Committer Paperwork
-------------------

The Eclipse Foundation needs to ensure that all committers with write
access to the code, web site, and issue tracking system understand their role in
safeguarding the intellectual property of {forgeName}. The Eclipse Foundation also
needs to ensure that we have accurate records of the people who are
acting as change agents on the projects. To ensure that
committers understand their role, and that that Eclipse Foundation has
accurate records, committers must provide documentation asserting
that they have read, understood, and will follow the committer guidelines, and to have
their employer sign that they agree that the new committer
can participate at {forgeName} and can contribute under the terms of the
project license.

All committers must complete the 'Committer Questionnaire' and provide documentation
as described below.

[[paperwork-questionnaire]]
Committer Questionnaire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {committerQuestionnaireUrl}[Committer Questionnaire] is an online form that
must be completed by all new committers. This form offers two separate paths:
one for committers who work for a member company that has provided a signed
Member Committer Agreement, and one for everybody else.

NOTE: The 'Committer Questionnaire' is accessible only after you have been elected as 
a committer on a project, either as an initial committer on a new project, or 
via election on an existing project.

Only member companies that have provided a signed Member Committer Agreement
will be listed as member companies in the Committer Questionnaire.

[[paperwork-documents]]
Documents
~~~~~~~~~

The exact nature of the documentation required is dependent on your
employments status.

Documents must be printed, signed and then returned either by fax 
(using the fax number on the form) or as scanned images via email 
to {emoRecordsEmail}.

[[paperwork-mca]]
Member Committer Agreement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The {mcaUrl}[Member Committer Agreement] (MCA) is used by member companies to 
cover all of their employees who participate in Eclipse Foundation projects 
as committers. 

If your employer has provided a signed MCA, then you most likely do not
require any additional paperwork. 

NOTE: MCAs make committer paperwork easy, especially if you
work for a member company that employs multiple committers. With an MCA a
company can provide signed documentation once, rather than once for each
employee (as required for an Individual Committer Agreement).

If your employer has not already provided an MCA, consult with your management
team to determine who has the necessary authority to sign it on your company's
behalf. Provide the MCA in advance of the completion of your committer election
or new project creation to streamline the committer provisioning process. 
If you and your management team are not sure whether or 
not your employer has an MCA, ask mailto:{emoRecordsEmail}[EMO Records].

If your employer is a member company that cannot provide a signed 
MCA, then you'll have to complete an Individual Committer Agreement and 
Eclipse Committer Employer Consent Form.

[[paperwork-ica]]
Individual Committer Agreement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Individual Committer Agreement (ICA) greement is used by committers 
who are not covered by an Member Committer Agreement.

You will need to provide an ICA if:

* You work for member company that has not signed a Member Committer Agreement;
* You work for a company that is not a member of the Eclipse Foundation;
* You are self employed or not employed; or
* You are a student.

If you provide an Individual Committer Agreement, and are employed
or self-employed, then you also need an 'Eclipse Committer Employer'
Consent Form.
 
[[paperwork-ececf]]
Eclipse Committer Employer Consent Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Committers covered by an Individual Committer Agreement must document 
the consent of their employer when participating in Eclipse Foundatio 
projects by providing an Eclipse Committer Employer Consent Form (ECECF).

You will need to provide an {ececfUrl}[ECECF] if:

* You work for member company that has not signed a Member Committer Agreement; 
* You work for a company that is not a member of the Eclipse Foundation; or
* You are self-employed.

If you are self employed, an owner of your own company, or
have full ownership or part ownership in another company and has the
authority to sign and submit the  Eclipse Committer Employer Consent Form
on your own behalf, then they should do so.

Alternatively, you may arrange for the company that is
your principal business customer to sign and submit the
Eclipse Committer Employer Consent Form on your behalf.

[[paperwork-existing]]
Existing Committer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are already a committer on an existing Eclipse Foundation project then 
additional paperwork may or may not be needed. The EMO IP Team will ask for
additional documentation if required.

If that MCA or ECECF already explicitly covers you for the 
new project, or that MCA or ECECF is universal (for all projects), 
then no additional paperwork is required

If you are covered by an MCA or ECECF that does not include
the new project, then the candidate must provide the documents as described
above.

[[paperwork-not-employed]]
Not Employed or Student
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not employed or are a student, send a note to {emoRecordsEmail}
explaining your not employed or student status.

NOTE: We require this email because most new committers are employed by a company,
the Eclipse Legal Team assumes that is the case for everyone, thus exceptions
need to be noted.

Frequently Asked Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[qanda]
What happens if I do not fill out the paperwork?::
	Then you don't get your login and password for write-access to the
	source code repository(s). Sorry. No exceptions.

What happens if I cannot convince my employer to fill out the paperwork?::
	The Eclipse Board of Directors has taken a firm position that if you are
	employed then you must meet one of the scenarios described above. If you cannot
	convince your employer to fill out the necessary paperwork, then you may
	not have write-access to project resources. This is the
	Board's position _even if_ you are working on {forgeName} projects on your
	own time. We realize that this prevents some talented and desirable
	people from being able to commit to the projects but this is our
	IP risk reduction strategy. 

Where can I get help to discuss these documents with my management team? ::
	The EMO and the Executive Director are happy to talk to your management
	and senior executives about these (and other) legal documents to
	help them understand why these documents are the best risk reduction
	solution for everyone involved (The Eclipse Foundation, you, and your 
	employer); just contact us at license@eclipse.org.

What formats can be used to submit paper documentation? ::
	The Eclipse Foundation accepts any of the following formats for
	submitting a paper form:
	* Print, sign, and postal mail the form to the Eclipse Foundation;
	* Print, sign, and fax the form to the Eclipse Foundation; or
	* Print, sign, scan, and email to the scan as an attachment to the Foundation

What Email address should I use to send scanned documents? ::	
	Email scans of the completed paperwork to EMO Records at {emoRecordsEmail}.

What if a committer changes employers? ::
	If you change employers, please contact {emoRecordsEmail}.
