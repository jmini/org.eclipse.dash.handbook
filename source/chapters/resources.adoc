Project Resources and Services
------------------------------
Open source projects at the Eclipse Foundation are required to make use
of certain Eclipse Foundation services:

* All project issues must be tracked in the {bugzillaUrl}[{forgeName} Bugzilla]
instance;
* Source code must be maintained in source code repositories assigned to the
project (e.g. {aforgeName} {gitUrl}[Git] or {gerritUrl}[Gerrit] instance,
or the {gitHubUrl}[{forgeName} Organization] on GitHub);
* All third-party libraries used by the project must be tracked and
approved for use by the Eclipse IP Team;
* Downloads must be distributed via a forge-specific downloads server;
* Developer (committer) communication must occur in the _dev_ list
provided to the project by the Eclipse; and
* Projects must keep their <<pmi-metadata, Project Metadata>> up-to-date.

[[resources-source]]
Source Code Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your project must maintain source code in the repositories assigned to the
project by the Eclipse Foundation. These official repositories must be
the exclusive source of all project code delivered via the project's assigned
distribution channel (e.g. the download server).

In order for your project to operate in an _open_ manner, it must be possible
for potential contributors to have access to the code base in its most current
form, so all ongoing development must be regularly pushed to these canonical 
repositories.

[[resources-cla]]
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Eclipse Foundation has implemented {claUrl}[Contributor License Agreements] (CLA) 
to improve <<ip,intellectual property>> (IP) management and workflow. All
contributors, who are not committers on the {forgeName} project, must sign the CLA.

You do *not* require a CLA to contribute to a project on which you have committer
status.

[[resources-commit]]
Git Commit Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Git commit records are required to take a specific form. The credentials
of the actual author must be used to populate the +Author+ field. The email 
address used must match the email address that the Eclipse Foundation has
on file for the author (case-sensitive).

The commit message is divided into three sections:

. One line (max 72 characters) summary;
. Description; and
. Footer.

.Example Git Commit Record
[source]
------------------------------------------------------------
commit d6cf52411377a039fc2906378711091a26e932cb
Author: Some Body <somebody@somewhere.com> <1>
Date:   Wed May 29 16:17:36 2013 +0200

    Bug 350686 - Hide unwanted action bar items <2>
    
    This change hides unwanted 'Link with Editor' and 
    'Customize View...' items from the local toolbar 
    and the view menu.
    
    Change-Id: Ia2bd5091303d1b0a738157effc24e4dac5a7d0c7 <3>
    Also-by: Some Bodyelse <somebodyelse@nowhere.com> <4>
    Signed-off-by: Some Body <somebody@somewhere.com> <5>
------------------------------------------------------------

<1> The email address of the author must match the email address on the Eclipse Foundation account.
<2> Best practice: include the bug id in the commit message summary.
<3> Gerrit change id (only when pushing to Gerrit for review).
<4> Additional authors can be added using +Also-by+ entries.
<5> Non-committers must _sign-off_ the commit using the same email address as used in the author field.

The _summary_ line is used in many places where Git commits are listed, ensure
that this line is sensible by itself. The _description_ area should be used to provide
more detail about the commit. The footer area is used for extra fields and values.

If the bug id is included in the summary line (using the form "Bug 12345 - xxx" or "[12345] xxx")
Gerrit Code Review will automatically add a link in the 
corresponding Bugzilla record back to the Gerrit record (this, of course, only 
applies to commits pushed to Gerrit).

The +Change-Id+ is used by <<resources-gerrit,Gerrit Code Review>> to associate new versions 
of a change back to its original review. This field need only be specified if the 
repository is managed by Gerrit.

Create a separate +Also-by+ field for each additional author of a commit. This might
apply, for example, if a commit has been authored via pair-programming, or the commit
is the result of collapsing multiple commits authored by multiple developers.

Commits that are provided by non-committers must have a +Signed-off-by+ field in the 
footer indicating that the author is aware of the terms by which the contribution has been
provided to the project. The non-committer must additionally have an Eclipse Foundation
account and must have a signed <<resources-cla,Contributor License Agreement>> (CLA)
on file.

[[resources-git]]
Git
^^^
Those projects that want to use Git on the {forgeName} forge, are assigned a 
directory in which they may create as many Git repositories as required.
{gitRequestUrl}[Open a bug] to request that the Webmaster create a new Git
repository for your project. Alternatively, committers with shell accounts
can create repositories themselves.

[subs="attributes"]
.Create a new Git repository
-----------------------------------------------------
> initrepo /gitroot/project/{namespace}.repo.name.git
-----------------------------------------------------

For consistency, the name of the repository must end with +.git+.

To set the description of the repository, use +sftp+ or +scp+ to copy a text file to
+/gitroot/project/{namespace}.repo.name.git/description+. Git repository 
descriptions should be limited to a paragraph of one or two sentences.

Only project committers can push to {aForgeName} Git repository. A push
that includes commits that do not conform to the required form will be rejected.

You can {gitUrl}[browse {forgeName} repositories] directly on the Git server.

[[resources-gerrit]]
Gerrit Code Review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
https://www.gerritcodereview.com/[Gerrit] provides web based code review and 
repository management for the Git version control system. Many projects use
Gerrit to reduce barriers and encourage contribution to the project.
{gerritRequestUrl}[Open a bug] to request that the Webmaster configure your
Git repository for Gerrit. 

Commits may be pushed directly to the Git repository through Gerrit by 
a project committer (e.g. to the +master+ branch).

Anybody can push to a +refs/for/*+ branch for review in a Gerrit repository. A push
that includes commits that do not conform to the required form will be rejected.
Commits intended for review should have a 
https://git.eclipse.org/r/Documentation/user-changeid.html[+Change-Id+]

You can {gerritUrl}[browse {forgeName} repositories] directly on the Gerrit 
server.

[[resources-github]]
GitHub
^^^^^^
Projects may opt to move some or all of their canonical source code repositories to the
{gitHubUrl}[{forgeName} organization] on GitHub.

NOTE: Projects that host source code on GitHub are not permitted to use GitHub
Issues or Wiki.

{gitHubRequestUrl}[Open a bug] to request that the Webmaster create a new, or move
an existing, Git repository for your project. The Webmaster will install some 
_hooks_ on your GitHub repository.

The _Committers hook_ grants designated project committers write access to the 
GitHub-hosted project repositories. Project committers must use the email address they 
provide to the Eclipse Foundation as their GitHub email address. 

The <<resources-cla,Contributor License Agreement>> (CLA) hook will inspect incoming 
GitHub pull requests to ensure that the contributor has a valid CLA on file, and that
the commit has been "signed-off" as required. Project committers should only merge pull 
_green_ requests:

image::images/Github-cla-success.png[]

The GitHub API does not give us a means of absolutely denying a merge; all we can 
do is warn you that the contributors have not signed a CLA:

image::images/Github-cla-failure.png[]

Do not merge unless you are absolutely certain that the contributer does have a 
valid CLA on file (e.g. the Contributor License Agreement Lookup Tool confirms 
that they have a CLA).

You must manually check that the commit message includes the 
required "Signed-off-by" statement in the footer.

The Webmaster creates and maintains a mirror of all GitHub-hosted
repositories on Eclipse Foundation hardware.

[[resources-libraries]]
Third-party Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{forgeName} projects must register all of their <<ip-third-party,third-party library>> use with the
IP Team.

[[resources-forums]]
Forums and Outbound Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All projects are assigned a {forumsUrl}[user forum] as a point of contact between
the user and adopter communities, and the project developers.

The EMO strongly encourages the use of alternative communication channels for
connecting with the community: your project team knows your community and how
to best connect with them.

[[resources-website]]
Project Websites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Project websites are an excellent way to connect your project with
your community. Many projects opt to use the <<pmi,Project Management Infrastructure>>
(PMI) as their project website,
but if so-desired, a project may host a website on Eclipse Foundation-hosted
servers. 

Project website sources are hosted in Git repositories maintained by the
Eclipse Foundation. {websiteRequestUrl}[Open a bug] to request that the Webmaster 
create a website for your project.

NOTE: Alternative hosting services for project-specific websites are
not permitted. Websites _not_ hosted by the Eclipse Foundation are
considered third-party and so are subject to the
{trademarkGuidelinesUrl}[Guidelines for Eclipse
Logo & Trademarks] (the Eclipse foundation asserts ownership of the
project name trademark).

[[resources-builds]]
Builds
~~~~~~
Use of Eclipse Foundation-provided and hosted build services, the so-called
{cbiUrl}[Common Build Infrastructure] (CBI) is strongly recommended, but n
ot strictly required. 

Whether or not your project chooses to make use of provided build resources, it must
be possible for members of the community to build project artifacts from 
source code with reasonable effort.

[[resources-signing]]
Signed Artifacts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Where technically sensible, all downloadable artifacts should
be {jarSigningUrl}[signed] by an Eclipse Foundation-provided certificate.

[[resources-downloads]]
Downloads
~~~~~~~~~
Project artifacts (e.g. downloads) can be distributed via third-party
services (e.g. Maven Central), but the Eclipse Foundation-provided
infrastructure must be considered the primary source of project
downloads. 

Project committers can {downloadsUrl}[upload project artifacts] to the project's 
directory on the download server.
